# MERN Stack E-Commerce Application

This project is a full-stack e-commerce web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It allows users to browse products, manage a shopping cart, and perform secure checkouts using a payment gateway. The application includes both client and server components and demonstrates how to integrate a backend API with a React frontend, along with user authentication, product management, and payment processing.
